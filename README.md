## A data-driven decision

To run this program, you must have Python 3 installed on your computer.  You will also need to download the MovieLens 100k database and store those files with movie_lib.py.
To run the program, you will need to be in the folder where you have stored MovieLens (u.data, u.user, and u.items) and movie_lib.py.

## Description
What To Watch will give you movie recommendations based on those with the highest rating by others who have seen the movie.
If you would like more specific recommendations, you can be matched to others with similar tastes in movies, to see which they rank highly.  Those movies which you have already seen will be filtered out.
